# Film Query Project

# Description
This program queries a local mySQL database and provides certain Film and Actor data from the database depending on the option chosen from the user at the menu. All of the logic for the application control-flow is located in the FilmQueryApp class, while the database query methods are located in the Database Access Object(DAO) class.

The goal of this program is to apply best practices and proper Java OOP structure when utilizing JDBC to communicate with a SQL database. In this program we are interacting with a local mySQL database, but this program could be easily refactored to work with any type of SQL database with the same database structure.

# Lessons Learned
This project was a lesson in utilizing JDBC and mySQL with a Java OOP mindset. The repeated refinement of SQL queries and Database Access Object(DAO) methods solidified the requirements for querying a mySQL database. The DAO also was a great class to work with in order to get familiar with dealing with classes that mirror database tables.

Overall, the this project was just a great lesson in reading from a mySQL database and choosing which interaction to use via CLI.
